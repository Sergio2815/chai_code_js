// these are the basic operations easy to 
// guess the answers as boolean values that either it is true or false

console.log(null>0); //here it is false
console.log(null==0);//false
console.log(null>=0);//true
/*
in js equality check=== and compariosn <>>== work
differently as if we equality on null==0 then it is false
and then again if we check so you can try differently

***if we check with undefined then it will give
false in all compariosn operator or equality ooerator
===
console.log("2"===2)
here in triple equal to it check the data types whether they are equal or not
unlike double operator they dont check by converting it
